    <p class="gameForm">{{male name}} was a {{job title}} who loved technology. Although he loved parts of his job, he absolutely hated {{tedious task}} and {{dirty task}}. So, {{male name}} met with his life mentor {{celebrity}} who told him to learn how to {{useless skill}} with Scott's. Scott's didn't offer a course on {{useless skill}} so he studied programming instead.
        <br>
        <br> What a great decision! With his new skills, {{male name}} built a(n) {{adjective}} robot named {{obnoxious celebrity}} that not only {{dirty task}} but did it {{huge number}} faster.
